# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
## Exploring Weather Trends-Project

The aim of the project is to analyze and visualize the local and global temperature data. I have considered “Bangalore” as my local city and compared it with overall global temperature trends. This report focuses on providing five interesting insights/observations about the change in temperature trends. The trends about the weather data (local and global) has been visualized using Excel, where SQL query is used to extract the data from Udacity website.
